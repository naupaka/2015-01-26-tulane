<div class="challenge" markdown="1">
The command `ls -R` lists the contents of directories recursively,
i.e., lists their sub-directories, sub-sub-directories, and so on

The command `ls -t` lists things by time of last change,
with most recently changed files or directories first.
In what order does `ls -R -t` display things?
