#### Objectives
*   Use `grep` to select lines from text files that match simple patterns.
*   Use `find` to find files whose names match simple patterns.
*   Use the output of one command as the command-line parameters to another command.
*   Explain what is meant by "text" and "binary" files, and why many common tools don't handle the latter well.
